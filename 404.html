    <h1>Oops! Looks like you've stumbled upon uncharted territory.</h1>

    <h2>404: Page Not Found</h2>

    <p>
      I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems that the page you're
      searching for has gone on an adventure of its own. It might have taken a
      wrong turn or decided to explore a different dimension altogether.<br />
      Don't worry, though. We've dispatched our digital explorers to track it
      down and bring it back home.
